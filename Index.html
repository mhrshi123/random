            And during the few moments that
             we have left, we want to have 
             just an off-the-cuff chat between you and me — us.
              We want to talk right down to earth in a language
               that everybody here can easily understand. We
                all agree tonight, all of the speakers have 
                agreed, that America has a very serious problem. Not only does America have a very serious problem, but our people have a very serious problem. America’s problem is us. We’re her problem. The only reason she has a problem is she doesn’t want us here. And every time you look at yourself, be you black, brown, red, or yellow — a so-called Negro — you represent a person who poses such a serious problem for America because you’re not wanted. Once you face this as a fact, then you can start plotting a course that will make you appear intelligent, instead of unintelligent.
